# Generic Functions for Database Objects in R

When using the **DBI** package in **R**, I found it was missing some
of the basic generic functions like `$`, `[[`, `length`, `names`, etc,
and as such I was interacting with databases in a non-idiomatic way.
This package adds those missing functions.

**WARNING** Mostly undocumented, and still a work in progress.
