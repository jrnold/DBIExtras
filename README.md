# Generic Functions for Database Objects in R

When using the **DBI** package in **R**, I found it was missing some
of the basic generic functions like `$`, `[[`, `length`, `names`, etc,
and as such I was interacting with databases in a non-idiomatic way.
This package adds those missing functions.

I'm still figuring out how to document S4 objects correctly with
roxygen, so the documenation is basically nonexistant. However, the
source code is only a single file.
